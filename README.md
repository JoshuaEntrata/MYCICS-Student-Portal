# MYCICS-Student-Portal

A website project for ICS2609: Applications Development and Emerging Technologies 2 (Enterprise-Back-End).

  The MYCICS Student Portal is a web-based application allowing the College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS) to collect and manage student data. The system provides a comprehensive view of each studentâ€™s academic journey, including personal information, academic performance, attendance, behavior, and other relevant data.

  The system is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with role-based access levels that allow different users to view, edit, or delete student data based on their roles and responsibilities. The system is built using Java as the programming language and Apache Derby as the database management system. 
  
  Students and administrators will receive their respective accounts upon enrollment in the institution. Once the administrators commence employment, they will be granted a unique username and password, which they can modify at their discretion. 
  
  The system admins will be able to update or delete selected information of every student, while students will only be able to view their own data.
